# How to contribute to extension "workshops" for TYPO3

 1. **Keep the code simple.** Good code does not need to be overly complex or complicated. Keeping it simple lowers the bar for other contributors and makes debugging easier.
 
 2. **Make sure it is clean.** Your code has to comply with the TYPO3 CGL. In addition, we're quite picky about a few things, like self-explanatory method and variable names.
 
 3. **Create a pull request.** Make sure to have a proper description which matches the TYPO3 Commit Message Guidelines. 
 
 4. **Provide tests.** We're not (yet) blocking development by wanting tests for any tiny bit of code, but be sure to cover important parts.
